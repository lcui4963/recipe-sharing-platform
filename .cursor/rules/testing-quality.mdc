# Testing and Quality

## Strategy
- Favor React Testing Library for components; test behavior and a11y over implementation.
- Include edge cases and error scenarios. Validate error boundaries and Suspense fallbacks.
- Unit test pure utilities; integration test key flows.

## Linting & Formatting
- Keep ESLint and Prettier enabled; fix new issues before merging.
- Do not introduce `any`. Maintain type coverage.

## Security
- Avoid leaking secrets to the client. Validate user input on the server.
- Sanitize/escape untrusted content; prefer safe components over `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.
