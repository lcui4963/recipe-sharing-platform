# UI, Accessibility, and Performance

## Styling
- Tailwind for layout/spacing; use CSS variables for theming in [app/globals.css](mdc:app/globals.css).
- Prefer Shadcn UI components and Radix primitives for accessibility.
- Mobile-first; ensure responsive design across breakpoints.

## Accessibility
- Add ARIA attributes thoughtfully; ensure keyboard navigation.
- Provide alt text for images; verify color contrast.
- Test with a screen reader when possible.

## Performance
- Use `next/image` with proper sizes and lazy loading; prefer WebP/AVIF.
- Use `next/font` for automatic font optimization.
- Apply code splitting via dynamic imports when heavy dependencies are client-side only.
- Monitor Web Vitals and regressions.
