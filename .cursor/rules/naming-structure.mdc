# Naming and Structure

## Directories & Files
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories: `components/auth-wizard`.
- Co-locate component helpers and types with the component when small; extract to `lib/` for broader reuse.

## Components
- Prefer named exports. Default exports only for Next.js pages/layouts when required by convention.
- Order: exports → subcomponents → helpers → types.
- Keep components small and focused. Compose rather than add props for rare needs.

## Events & Props
- Event handlers start with `handle...`. Boolean props with auxiliary verbs.
- Avoid overly generic prop names. Prefer explicit, typed, narrow props.
